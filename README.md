Step 3: Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/Arpittak/factoproject.git
cd factoproject


Step 4: Database Setup
Note: To run code in MySQL Workbench: Click on MySQL root connection → Enter password → Terminal will open → Put code in terminal → Select the code → Click on the electricity/lightning bolt icon on top of the code.

Open MySQL Workbench and connect to the root connection.
Create a new database in the terminal:
sql:  CREATE DATABASE factodb;
aq2:  USE factodb;

sql3: Open the schema.sql file from the repository, copy all its code, and run it inside MySQL Workbench following the note above.

note again: if you got an error then run sql2


Step 5: Backend Setup
Navigate to the server directory:
bash
   cd server
   npm install
Create a .env file in the server/ directory: Note: Do not forget to put your password created at the time of installation of MySQL Workbench.
env
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
   DB_NAME=factodb
   PORT=5000

Step 6: Frontend Setup
Navigate to the client directory:
bash
   cd client
   npm install


6. Running the Application
Start the Backend Server
Open a terminal, navigate to the server directory, and run:

bash
cd server
node app.js
Start the Frontend Development Server
Open a second terminal, navigate to the client directory, and run:

bash
cd client
npm run dev
Access Points
Frontend: http://localhost:5173
Backend API: http://localhost:5000
Database: localhost:3306/factodb

9. Database Schema
Core Tables
stones: Master stone types
vendors: Vendor information
procurements: Procurement records
procurement_items: Items within procurements
inventory_items: Unique inventory items
inventory_transactions: Log of all inventory movements
stages: Processing stages
edges_types: Edge finishing types
finishing_types: Surface finishing types
hsn_codes: HSN codes for tax
Key Relationships
Procurement → Procurement Items → Inventory Items
Inventory Items → Inventory Transactions (audit trail)
All items are linked to master data tables (stones, stages, vendors)


10. API Endpoints
Inventory Management
GET    /api/inventory              # Get all inventory items
POST   /api/inventory/manual-add   # Add inventory manually
POST   /api/inventory/manual-adjust# Adjust quantities
DELETE /api/inventory/:id          # Delete inventory item
GET    /api/inventory/analytics    # Get inventory statistics
Procurement Management
GET    /api/procurements           # Get all procurements
POST   /api/procurements           # Create new procurement
GET    /api/procurements/:id       # Get procurement details
POST   /api/procurements/:id/items # Add item to procurement
DELETE /api/procurements/items/:id# Delete procurement item

GET /api/master/hsn-codes         # Get HSN codes
GET /api/vendors                  # Get all vendors

11. Business Logic & Implementation
Business Logic
Quantity Management: All calculations are based on square meters (sq_meter) as the master unit. Piece counts are derived using Math.ceil(sq_meter / area_per_piece).
Inventory Transactions: Every change to inventory (add, remove, procurement) creates a transaction record, ensuring a complete audit trail.
Procurement-Inventory Integration: New procurements and item additions/deletions automatically update inventory levels. Financial amounts are frozen at the time of procurement creation.
Features Implementation
Responsive Design: A mobile-first approach ensures adaptive layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
Real-time Calculations: Unit conversions and procurement totals are calculated live in the UI.
Data Validation: Both frontend forms and backend APIs include validation to ensure data integrity.

12. Troubleshooting
Common Issues
MySQL Connection Error:

Ensure the MySQL server is running
Double-check the database credentials in the server/.env file
Verify that the factodb database exists
Port Already in Use:

If backend port 5000 is in use, check for other running applications
Vite will automatically find the next available port if 5173 is taken
Schema Import Error:

Make sure you are using the correct database (USE factodb;)
Verify the schema.sql file path and user permissions
Module Not Found Errors:

Run npm install in both the server and client directories
CORS Issues:

The backend is pre-configured for CORS. Verify the frontend URL matches the settings if issues arise
Database Reset
To completely reset the database, run the following SQL commands:

sql
DROP DATABASE factodb;
CREATE DATABASE factodb;
USE factodb;
-- Then re-run the schema.sql script


13. Contributing
